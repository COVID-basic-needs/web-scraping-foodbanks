This form link will go out every day on ParentSquare around 10AM and should be filled out for the NEXT day.

In an effort to control traffic during the pick-up time, we ask that you turn approach the elementary from School Street and turn right into the pick-up lane at the Elementary School. The idea is to have everyone approach the pick-up lane with the drivers-side of the vehicle facing the building (so we will not have to cross in front of traffic to hand out the sacks.
